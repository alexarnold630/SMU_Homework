# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Background
Build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

## Objectives
1. Use the D3 library to read in samples.json.
2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
4. Create a gauge chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
5. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
6. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
7. Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
